## 1. d3.js

I loaded the CSV file using `d3.csv()`, mapped the flipper length and body mass to x and y axes, and set color and size scales for species and bill length.

- Easy: Mapping data to axes using `d3.scaleLinear()` and creating axes.  
- Difficult: Handling asynchronous data loading and making sure points render only after the CSV is loaded.  
- Usefulness: Ideal for interactive web visualizations and custom designs.  
- Hacks/Data manipulation: Filtered out rows with missing bill length values to avoid rendering errors.

## 2. p5.js
 
I used p5.js to draw circles for each penguin, scaling the x and y positions manually and mapping color and size to the data.

- Easy: Drawing and styling circles on canvas.  
- Difficult: Manually creating axes and scales, no built-in chart functions.  
- Usefulness: Great for artistic or experimental visualizations where traditional chart libraries are limiting.  
- Hacks/Data manipulation: Normalized flipper length and body mass to fit canvas dimensions.

## 3. Altair (Python)

I created the scatterplot using `alt.Chart()` with `.mark_circle()`, encoding x, y, color, and size directly from the dataset.

- Easy: Declarative syntax made mapping data attributes simple.  
- Difficult: Customizing axes scales beyond the default required some extra parameters.  
- Usefulness: Excellent for quick, clean visualizations in Python with minimal code.  
- Hacks/Data manipulation: Dropped missing values using `pandas.dropna()` to avoid plotting errors.

## 4. Plotly (Python)
I used `px.scatter()` to map flipper length vs. body mass, setting color to species and size to bill length, with opacity set to 0.8.

- Easy: Interactive plots with hover info are built-in.  
- Difficult: Adjusting axes to match the example scales.  
- Usefulness: good for dashboards or sharing interactive charts online.  
- Hacks/Data manipulation: Filtered dataset to remove missing bill lengths.

## 5. Vega-Lite

I defined a JSON specification for the scatterplot, encoding x, y, color, size, and opacity.
 
- Easy: Declarative JSON made reproducing the scatterplot straightforward.  
- Difficult: Understanding Vega-Lite syntax for size and color scaling.  
- Usefulness: Good for formal, shareable visualization specifications that are portable across platforms.  
- Hacks/Data manipulation: Adjusted axis scales to approximate the example plot.

## Technical Achievements

- Interactive visualizations - hover interactions for d3.js and Plotly plots 
- Data cleaning - iltered missing bill length values consistently across all tools.

## Design Achievements

- Color consistency: Species colors were kept consistent across all five visualizations.  
- Opacity for overlapping points: All scatterplots use semi-transparent circles for better visibility.  
- Readable axes and labels: Customized tick intervals and labels for clarity.  
- Size mapping: Bill length consistently used for circle size to highlight variation.
